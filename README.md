This is a lightweight Carbon Footprint Tracker designed to estimate the **carbon savings** achieved by recycling paper. It uses **height, weight, and number of pages** as inputs to calculate environmental impact.

## 🧮 How It Works

The tracker calculates estimated **carbon footprint reduction** based on:
- 📏 **Height** of the paper stack
- ⚖️ **Weight** of the paper
- 📄 **Number of pages**

It applies simple logic or formulas to estimate how much CO₂ emissions are avoided by recycling instead of discarding.
